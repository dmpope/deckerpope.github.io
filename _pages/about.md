I am an incoming MA student in French Linguistics at Indiana University Bloomington (IUB). I recieved BAs in Linguistics and French (minor in Centural Eurasian Studies) from IUB. My research interests include bilingual sentence processing, syntax-semantics interface, and regional languages of France.
