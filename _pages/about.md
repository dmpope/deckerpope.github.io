I am a junior undergraduate at Indiana University Bloomington completing my B.A. in Linguistics (minor Central Eurasian Studies) and French. My research focuses on the simultaneous processing of music and language. I serve as a reviewer for the <a href="https://iujur.iu.edu/">Indiana University Journal of Undergraduate Research</a> and as a lab assistant for the IUB's <a href="https://celt.indiana.edu/">Center for Language Technology</a>.
