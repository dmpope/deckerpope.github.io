I am an incoming MA student in French Linguistics at Indiana University Bloomington (IUB), where I recieved BAs in Linguistics (minor in Centural Eurasian Studies) and French in 2022. My research interests include bilingual sentence processing, syntax-semantics interface, and regional languages of France. To learn more about me and see what I am up to, check out my <a href="https://dmpope.github.io/year-archive/">blog</a>.
